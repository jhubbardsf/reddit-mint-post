# Reddit Mint Bot

Bot that uses HTML -> Image generation to create an image of a reddit post and mint it with Poster/Subreddit attributes if a user mentions the bot in the following format:

/u/CommentNFTMinter 0xTHEIR_POLY_ADDRESS

Note: I've been testing it around in /r/CommentNFTTest. Idk how well my bot will work elsewhere since it's brand new (and has low karma so might get caught in a lot of spam filters), but he's an approved submitted to that test subreddit.
